# Bank Customers Churn Analysis

In this assignment, I performed some data transformations using python. Apart from that, I also carried out analysis with the help of visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as some statistical analysis with the help of Scipy. 

To present the results in an interactive format, I developed a dashboard in Looker Studio, which can be accessed through the following link: https://bit.ly/BankChurnDashboard

## Dataset Used

The dataset, titled "Churn Modeling", appears to be related to customer retention analysis for a company. It contains a variety of customer attributes, including personal, financial, and account-related information. Key fields include CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts (number of products used by the customer), HasCrCard (indicating whether the customer has a credit card), IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, and Exited (indicating whether the customer has churned). This rich dataset likely facilitates the exploration of factors influencing customer churn and can be instrumental in developing strategies to improve customer retention.
